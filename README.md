# python.projects
I am a beginner coder looking to eventually gain the skills to freelance. Please feel free to review my code and make improvements to it!

In these files, I will place various projects I am working on. Most of them will be beginner-level, but over time I hope they will become more complex as people make changes to them and find errors.
